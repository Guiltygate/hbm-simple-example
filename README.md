A simple example of work done at HBM (shown with the explicit permission of HBM)

Note on PSQL: I don't remember why I used command-line sql queries via psql.py rather than using psycopg, especially since we used psycopg for other projects.
It may have been due to a dependency issue.

Note on Command-Line UI: This was due to time constraints and much of our other test software being command-line. We did not leave this style of UI behind until the
generic test framework I designed in 2017, which used Tkinter.
