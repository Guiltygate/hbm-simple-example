Note on PSQL: I don't remember why command-line sql queries were used rather than psycopg, especially since we used psycopg for other projects.
It may have been due to a dependency issue.

Note on Command-Line UI: This was due to time constraints and much of our other test software being command-line. We did not leave this style of UI behind until the
generic test framework I designed in 2017, which used Tkinter.
